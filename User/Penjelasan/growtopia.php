        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>Growtopia is a 2D massively multiplayer online sandbox video game based around the idea that most of the in-game items can be grown from seeds of trees. The game has no end goals or 100% completion, however, there is an achievement system and quests to complete from non-player characters.When a new player joins, they are sent to a private world called Tutorial, which teaches them the basics of the game by giving them quests through an item called the Growpedia. The player starts out with two basic tools: a fist for punching and breaking blocks and a wrench for editing block properties, adding players and trading items. Once they have finished the tutorial, they are sent to a world called Start so that they can learn more about the game.</p>
